    I work on additional research problems to provide analysis where it is not available from national services, via [LawlessGenomics.com](https://lawlessgenomics.com) (non-diagnostic for referral to clinical genetics). I am also building both the front-end and back-end on AWS for my GATK WGS pipeline including interactive evidence report with ∼150 database scores (e.g. gnomAD, ClinVar, ClinGen, UniProt, GO, OMIM, pathogenicity predictors, ACMG reporting standards, etc.)
